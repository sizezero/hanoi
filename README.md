# Primitive Tower's of Hanoi

I stopped by the [living computer museum](http://www.livingcomputers.org/) a couple weekends ago and found some amazing old unixy systems that are older than I am. I want to try to run some non-trivial program on them so I figured I'd code it up first.

I'm going to try a program that solves the [towers of hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) problem in a primitive version of C.

## Emulators

While writing this I figured it would be helpful to actually emulate some old machines to see how old C actually runs on old hardware. I [investigated some emulators](doc/emulators.md)

## Old C

There are definitely some quirks between [old C and new C](http://ee.hawaii.edu/~tep/EE160/Book/chapapx/node7.html). The most significant differences are:

* Variable declarations must come before all other instructions.
* Variable declarations cannot include assignments.
* Function arguments and types must be on separate lines.
* Only old fashioned comments are allowed.
* Void is not allowed as a function return type.
* Standard includes don't exist. (although `#define` does exist but the terminal has a hard time with non-escaped # characters)
* Heap allocation doesn't exist. No `malloc()`
* The parser is easily confused by ambiguity. Expressions such as `j==-1` are somehow interpreted as an assignment and should instead be written as `j == -1`

```C
func1() {
    int i=1; /* ERROR assignment not allowed in definition */
    i=3;
    int j; /* ERROR all declarations must be together */
    int k;
}

func1() {
    int i, j;
    int k;
    i=3;
}

func2(char* msg, int count) { /* ERROR can't combine names and types in fn parms */
}

func2(msg, count)
char* msg;
int count; {
}

// I'm a cutting edge one line comment
/* ERROR need to use old style comments */
```

## Editors

I guess the only editor you can count on is [ed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor))

I'm finding the old version of ed is even more primitive than the modern GNU one.

* Range parameters must be fully specified e.g. `1,5l` not `1,l.` You actually need to be aware of how many lines are currently in the file.
* Many commands are missing including `P`
* I don't see a manual for this anywhere. The archived PDFs of the online manuals seem to document a newer version with more commands.

# Other System Limitations

Filenames are limited to 14 characters. Longer filenames are often silently truncated.

Backspace and delete don't work. However `@` means ignore all previous characters and `#` means ignore the previous character. This means the line `cd@chdir rbo##obert` is interpreted as `chdir robert`

Ideally you should be able to develop a big C file in a modern environment and cut and paste it into an ancient machine's terminal. `gcc` actually compiles primitive C, it just adds lots of warnings. Unfortunately the terminal hangs on pastes that are larger than a couple hundred characters. One way around this is to paste into multiple files and then cat them together.

<pre>
$ <b>cat >p1.c
<i>paste first chunk</i>
^D</b>
$ <b>cat >p1.c
<i>paste second chunk</i>
^D</b>
$ <b>cat >p1.c
<i>paste third chunk</i>
^D</b>
$ <b>cat p?.c > p.c</b>
$ <b>cc p.c</b>
$ <b>./a.out</b>
</pre>

## Lessons

After using linux without history I started to make my filenames very short. Now I know where `cp`, `mv`, `du`, etc. came from.

Having to scope all variables at the top of the function means you may have to reuse the variables for different purposes. You might as well call them `i`, `j`, `k`

I am so used to compiler help. In particular no type checking is difficult.
