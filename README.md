# Primitive Tower's of Hanoi

I stopped by the living computer museum a couple weekends ago and found some amazing old unixy systems that are older than I am. I want to try to run some non-trivial program on them so I figured I'd code it up first.

I'm going to try a program that solves the towers of hanoi problem in a primitive version of C.
